# Neutrality Guidelines for Daily Briefings

## Purpose

These guidelines ensure all briefings maintain strict journalistic neutrality, presenting facts without advocacy, bias, or editorial opinion. The goal is informed readers, not persuaded ones.

## Core Principles

### 1. Report, Don't Interpret
- Present what happened, not what it means
- Let facts speak for themselves
- Avoid drawing conclusions for the reader

### 2. Show All Sides
- Every controversy has multiple perspectives
- Present opposing views with equal treatment
- Don't give more weight to one side through word choice or placement

### 3. Attribute Everything
- Every claim needs a source
- Use direct attribution: "According to...", "X stated..."
- Distinguish between facts and claims

## Language Standards

### Forbidden Terms

| Category | Forbidden | Use Instead |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Verdicts | confirmed, debunked, proven, false, true | "X claims...", "Y disputes..." |
| Advocacy | must, should, need to, important that | (remove or quote) |
| Emotion | shocking, outrageous, alarming | (describe the reaction, don't characterize) |
| Labels | far-left, far-right, extremist | (describe positions specifically) |
| Certainty | clearly, obviously, undoubtedly | (remove) |

### Required Hedging

When reporting unverified or contested information:
- "reportedly"
- "according to sources"
- "allegedly"
- "claims that"
- "[Source] stated that"

### Attribution Patterns

**Good:**
- "The government announced..."
- "According to a Reuters report..."
- "Critics argue that... while supporters contend..."
- "The data shows X, which economists interpret as..."

**Bad:**
- "Congress finally addressed..." (implies judgment)
- "The obvious solution..." (editorializing)
- "Experts agree..." (without specific attribution)
- "This proves..." (drawing conclusions)

## Structural Balance

### Story Structure
1. Lead with the most newsworthy fact
2. Present primary perspective with attribution
3. Present counter-perspective with equal attribution
4. Provide relevant context without editorializing
5. End with factual outlook (what happens next)

### Controversy Coverage
For any controversial topic:
- Identify all major positions
- Give each position fair representation
- Use parallel structure (same treatment for each side)
- Avoid "but" when transitioning between positions (implies one is wrong)

### Opinion vs. Fact
- Clearly label editorial content
- Don't mix opinion into news summaries
- When reporting opinions, attribute them explicitly
- Never present opinions as facts

## Verification Standards

### Source Hierarchy
1. **Primary sources** - Official documents, direct statements
2. **Major wire services** - Reuters, AP, AFP
3. **Established newspapers of record** - Major outlets with editorial standards
4. **Specialized outlets** - Industry/topic experts
5. **Social media** - Only with verification, clearly labeled as such

### Cross-Verification
- Single-source claims must be labeled as such
- Significant claims need 2+ independent sources
- Conflicting reports should be noted
- Corrections/updates to previous reports should be highlighted

### Source Transparency
For each source, document:
- Publication name
- Date of publication
- Author (if available)
- Original language (if translated)
- Any known bias or perspective

## Neutrality Audit

### Process (Gate 6)
Single-pass audit checks all briefing content for:

**Language Check:**
- Scan for forbidden language patterns
- Identify advocacy framing
- Flag emotional language

**Balance Check:**
- Verify multiple perspectives on controversies
- Check attribution equality across viewpoints
- Ensure no favorable framing for any side

**Completeness Check:**
- Verify proportional axis coverage
- Confirm high-priority stories included
- Check word counts within ranges

### Pass Criteria
- No advocacy language remains
- All sides of controversies represented
- All claims properly attributed
- No unsupported conclusions
- No emotional characterization

## Common Pitfalls

### Selection Bias
- Don't only report news that supports one narrative
- Include stories that challenge assumptions
- Cover mundane but important developments

### Framing Bias
- Headlines should be neutral
- Lead paragraphs shouldn't favor one interpretation
- Story placement shouldn't imply importance judgment

### False Balance
- Don't equate fringe views with mainstream consensus
- Scientific consensus deserves appropriate weight
- Note when views are minority positions

### Passive Bias
- Don't bury important information
- Don't use passive voice to obscure actors
- Don't omit relevant context

## Regional Considerations

### International Coverage
- Be aware of regional media landscape biases
- Note differences between public and private media
- Consider geopolitical context

### National Coverage
- Balance perspectives across political spectrum
- Note partisan affiliations of sources
- Consider regional variation in impact

### Local Coverage
- Include diverse community perspectives
- Don't favor urban vs. suburban views
- Balance development/preservation viewpoints
